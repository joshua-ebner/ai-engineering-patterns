# Processed Data

This folder contains chunked and normalized documentation
used as the knowledge base for the RAG system.

Documents here are derived from raw sources and prepared for embedding and retrieval.

Each file typically contains:
- Chunked text
- Source metadata
- Document references

Phase 1 focuses on selected LangChain and OpenAI documentation.

Later phases will likely expand this corpus with LangGraph and LangSmith documentation.
